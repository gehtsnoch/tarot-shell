#  tarot-shell
#  a bash script for drawing tarotcards on a linux machine. 9 popular spreads are possible. 
#  You have to add your own deck to the right folder, maybe you find some free decks on the internet. 
# Ad the 78 cards in your home directory folder in /tarot-shell/Deck_1 folder ..............
# You can add till 28 decks to the program.
#
# You have to rename your cards in a special way, that means you have to give them numbers, otherwise the script is not working.
# The numbers have to start with a 1, then 2, and so on, till 77,78. 
# It's not possible to have a card that is a 0.
# Maybe you give the Fool the number 78. But that is not fixed, just avoid the zero.

# If you don't have terminal experience, follow the next steps, becuase you have to make the script excutable.
# Open your terminal and create a folder in your $HOME directory, call it maybe bin.
# Then copy the shell script in it and open a terminal.
# Go in the bin directory with the command "cd bin", then make the script excutable with " sudo chmod +x tarot-shell.sh"
# and then your password is required and the script will create several folders.
# 
# Start the script with ./tarot-shell.sh
#
# But remember now to add cards to the $HOME/tarot-shell/Decks/ folder.
#
# have fun and it would be nice if you contact me if its not working, but of course this is just a hobby project so don't
# expect to much.
